Copyright (C) 2015 Steven Braun

This repository provides the code for Manifold, an automated research impact analytics platform that was developed by Steven Braun for use in the University of Minnesota Libraries and Medical School.

ABOUT MANIFOLD

Manifold is a platform that creates web-accessible profiles of scholarly output and research impact for scholars. Profiles are generated for individual faculty, departments, and custom subsets of faculty. These profiles generate lists of publications (data thereof pulled through the Scopus API), metrics of research impact, and visualizations to contextualize those measures. These data can be exported for further custom analytics purposes.

ABOUT THE FILES

Manifold is built on a standard LAMP stack; all pages and data processes are executed via PHP scripts, data are stored in a MySQL database, and the platform is handled via a Linux/Apache server configuration. The code is intended to be lightweight and extensible to enable further development and institution-specific customization.
